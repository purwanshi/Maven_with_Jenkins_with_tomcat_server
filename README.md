# Maven_with_Jenkins_with_tomcat_server
This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Maven, and Apache Tomcat.
Whenever code is pushed to GitHub, Jenkins automatically:

Clones the repository

Builds the Maven project

Packages the application into a .war file

Deploys the final WAR to a running Tomcat server
